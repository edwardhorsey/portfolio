      <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&apos;m Ed</h2>
      <h3>I&apos;m an Oxford based musician turned software developer.</h3>
      <p>
        Moving from a musicial language to programming languages matched my passion for creating something fresh,
        beautiful and meaningful from a blank canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
        After working as a professional musician since leaving University, I decided to pursue a 12-week intensive
        software development bootcamp at _nology. The course fueled my passion for learning new skills, logical problem
        solving and creating meaningful applications.
